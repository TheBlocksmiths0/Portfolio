    <h2>Welcome</h2>
    <p>Hello reader! My name is <strong>Marco</strong>, or you can call me <strong>Primus</strong>.<br><br>
       I've been passionate about game developing since I was 13 years old, starting my journey with Roblox by trying to make my own game, later realizing that maybe jumping straight into a complex game without understanding a single code line wasn't the smartest move.<br><br>
       I then started taking private <strong>LUA</strong> (Roblox coding language) lessons by paying a guy on Fiverr, yeah I didn't really know YouTube tutorials existed at that time.<br><br>
       With a bit of trial and error I made my way into LUA coding and started working for a decently famous game at that time where I was the <strong>Head Developer</strong>, the game was called "an horrible day".<br><br>
       Needless to say I worked for free at that time, but I got some valuable experience that I later used to develop my own projects, projects that never really were released to the public since I was doing them just for personal passion.<br><br>
       A couple years passed and in the meantime I learned quite a few programming languages at school, like <strong>C</strong>, <strong>C++</strong>, <strong>C#</strong>, <strong>Python</strong>, <strong>HTML</strong> (I know it's a markup language, I just didn't know where to fit it), <strong>Javascript</strong> and even a bit of Assembly.<br><br>
       With all that knowledge I thought it was time to level up my projects and start working on a more advanced platform, that being <strong>Unreal Engine 4</strong>.<br><br>
       So, with some friends, I decided to make my first ever actual game, initially we wanted to publish it for like a couple dollars but literally all the team except me stopped working on the project, and I'm not the best in making models, animations etc, so I just stopped working on it.<br><br>
       The game was an horror game which took place in my high school, basically it was the usual "There is a monster that chases you, do all the tasks before he catches you", but there were more monsters that were meant to distract you in the meantime, it wasn't actually a bad idea at all.<br><br>
       This project being left, I finally finished school and started working in a company here in Italy, called <strong>Sistemi SPA</strong>, which does basically management softwares for other big companies, might sound cool but I soon realized that it wasn't for me.<br><br>
       I decided to start working a second job on my own with a friend, basically making custom content on Minecraft (Learning <strong>Java</strong> too) on commission, using Fiverr as a customer source.<br><br>
       After a brief period though I got really tired, basically I was (And am since I'm in this situation right now) working 8:30AM to 17:30PM to my normal job, plus all the time I was home was spent on the second job.<br><br>
       Don't get me wrong I love this second job, but I think you can imagine that working all day isn't the best, so that's why right now I'm looking for a job!<br><br>
       I want to finally be able to do what I love, with a company (Or even a small business) that appriciates me and pays me right for my work!<br><br>
       In all honesty, I probably won't know <strong>everything</strong> you ask me to do, but since I was 13 I always made plans to do stuff I didn't know how to do, and always managed to learn mid-way in the project, I constantly try to surpass myself and make each line better everytime I make a mistake.<br><br>
       I might not be the most experienced dev in terms of knowledge, but personally I think experience is measured in passion and commitment to your work, rather then just "I learned this, I learned that" while playing solitaire when you're supposed to work; if you have the passion and you like what you work on there are no limits on how much you can learn and make in the shortest time possible.<br><br>
       So either if you're here from Fiverr, or randomly, or maybe through an application, and you're looking for passionate developers, then I hope this story made you think about hiring me!
